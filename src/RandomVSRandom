RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?

The second player has advantage over the first player. The second player
consistently wins about 50% of the time, while the first only wins
about 45% of the time, with about 5% of games being a tie.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

A lot of complicated statistics formulas can be represented as code that can
help simulate and produce data quickly. The video shows four recipes that
can help programmers better understand and use statics, direct simulation, shuffling,
bootstrapping, and cross validation.

4) H0 is
Null Hypothesis: claims that there’s no effect in the population.

5) Ha is
Alternative Hypothesis: claims that there’s an effect in the population.

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results support H0, so they do not support Ha
   //My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
